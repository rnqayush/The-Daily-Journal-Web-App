    title: "BMC plan to give rebate to hoarding owners",
    content:`The BMC‘s move to give rebate in the hike on annual advertising fees to hoarding owners who display messages related to Covid-19 pandemic drew criticism from Opposition parties on Friday. Calling it “injustice”, corporators demanded that similar rebates be given to other license holders as well.

    A proposal of waiver on advertisement fees and delay charges as well as rebate in the hike on annual advertising fees for hoarding owners in lieu of advertisements displayed related to Covid-19, was tabled before the Standing Committee for its approval on Friday.
    
    Taking up the cause of other license holders, Samajwadi Party MLA Rais Shaikh said: “I am not against this proposal but the benefits should be extended to civic body’s other license holders as well. The pandemic has affected other license holders and residents equally. They should be offered rebates and waivers.”
    
    Shaikh’s demand received support from Opposition leader and Congress corporator Ravi Raja as well NCP’s Rakhi Jadhav.
    
    However, Shiv Sena leader and Standing Committee Chairman Yashwant Jadhav refused to accept the demand and cleared the proposal. Following this, Congress, NCP and Samajwadi Party staged a walk out from the meeting.

    title: "Raje loyalists hit back at Beniwal, say free to leave NDA",
    content:`The on-going protests by farmers have once again brought to fore the differences between NDA ally Hanuman Beniwal and a section of state BJP leaders, mainly consisting of loyalists of former Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje.

    In a strongly-worded letter to NDA chairperson Amit Shah, Beniwal, who is the lone MP from the Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP), had said that the government should “immediately act” on withdrawing the three farm Bills.
    
    “If a decision is not taken over this issue with immediate effect, then RLP, which is a constituent party of the NDA, will have to reconsider on its decision to continue in the alliance. The strength of RLP is in farmers and jawans,” Beniwal said in the letter.
    
    This prompted an attack from Raje loyalists who urged Beniwal to leave the NDA.
    
    Beniwal, a former BJP leader and known Raje-baiter, has attacked Raje on numerous occasions in the last few years, accusing her of being hand-in-glove with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.
    
    In a joint statement, Raje loyalists consisting of former minister and incumbent MLA from Chhabra, Pratap Singh Singhvi, former MLAs Bhawani Singh Rajawat, Prahlad Gunjal and Vidyashankar Nandwana, as well as former Zila Pramukh Govind Singh Parmar said that “rather than tomorrow, he should break away today itself. BJP has no need of him. There was a time when he himself had approached BJP. BJP is a powerful party today and no party can compete with it. His so-called RLP is restricted to a handful of people of a particular caste.”
    
    They also asked him to desist from mudslinging at Raje, saying that she still “rules the hearts of crores of people.” The leaders also asked Shah and party national president J P Nadda “why is the party still tolerating him?” They said that the party has a huge voter base and lost the 2018 elections only by a margin of 1.5 lakh votes.
    
    Beniwal shot back at Singhvi, reminding him of alleged irregularities committed by him while he was the Urban Development and Housing minister and which were highlighted by Rajasthan Lokayukta.
    
    “It will be better if you strengthen the role of opposition in the democracy. By colluding with the Gehlot government, you cannot hide the scams and irregularities you are answerable for,” Beniwal said.
    
    Singhvi asked Beniwal to get the matter investigated and said that no case is pending against him. “I can also make personal accusations, but I have not inherited such political values,” Singhvi said.
    
    In a separate statement, former BJP state president Ashok Parnami said that “at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi is talking about making farmers self-reliant, rather than following the coalition dharma, he is threatening BJP and talking about leaving NDA.” He said that no one is stopping Beniwal from leaving.`

    title: "In a first, ICMR-NARI to study Covid antibody prevalence in HIV-affected",
    content:`Scientists at the Indian Council of Medical Research- National AIDS Research Institute plan to study the prevalence of antibodies against Covid-19 in HIV positive persons at the Anti-Retroviral Treatment Centre.

    The serological test (IgG antibody) will indicate if a person had a previous Covid-19 infection. Participants with IgG antibodies will be followed every three months to study the duration for which these antibodies remain in the body.
    
    Dr Manisha Ghate, Head, Division of Clinical Sciences and principal investigator of the study said approximately 410 people living with HIV will be involved in this study. She added, “It will also give information on whether there are any specific characteristics, risks or protective factors associated with asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection among persons living with HIV (PLHIV)”.
    
    Neutralisation antibody tests for SARS- CoV-2 will determine the functional ability of antibodies to prevent a virus infection, and will inform as to whether the antibodies developed are protective or not. The T-cell immune response, which plays an important role in supporting the immune system, will be studied by Dr. Madhuri Thakar, who heads the Immunology and Serology division. This response is useful in defending the body against SARS-CoV-2 from re-invading, by identifying and killing the infected cells, Dr Sheela Godbole, Head, Division of Epidemiology, ICMR-NARI said.
    
    Meanwhile, in June a study was initiated at NARI’s ART centre to understand the knowledge, attitude, and practices among People Living with HIV (PLHIV) towards Covid-19. Around 1,100 participants are involved and the study is underway, Dr Ghate said.

    Majority welcomed HIV self-test: Study
    
    HIV self-test is an approach where the person collects his or her own specimen (blood or saliva) then performs this test and interprets the results either alone or in presence of someone he or she trusts. While few countries like France, United States and United Kingdom have legally introduced HIV self-test kits, India is yet to adopt such a strategy. Scientists at ICMR- NARI explored the acceptability of an HIV oral self-test across various population groups such as gays, transgenders, truckers and young adults (18-24 years) in Pune district.

    A prototype in-country developed HIV oral self-test kit was presented to the participants to help facilitate the interviews and discussions. While conducting this study, Dr Sandip Patil and Dr Amrita Rao realised that most of the participants welcomed the self-test as it was easy to use, could be undertaken in privacy, showed quick results and allayed the trouble of going to the hospital.
    
    “We were convinced that HIV self-test could add the necessary momentum to the ongoing National AIDS Control Programme,” Dr Samiran Panda, principal investigator and Director, ICMR-NARI said. “It was a qualitative study conducted from March to July, 2019 where responses were obtained from 61 in-depth-interviews and 23 focus group discussions,” he added. The findings were recently published in Infectious Diseases: Research and Treatment. “None of the participants perceived that social harm of any kind could result from the introduction of this self-test. However, the participants did feel a need for clear messaging on how to do the test”, said Dr Rao, the co-principal investigator, adding that HIV self-testing has the potential to assist the programme to help people know their status.`},

    title: "Show construction progress to avail PMAY funds: Maharashtra civic bodies",
    content:`Learning from earlier adverse experience, civic bodies in Maharashtra have now changed the pattern of releasing the subsidy under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) to the beneficiaries to ensure the money is not diverted from the intended purpose of the house construction.

    Beneficiaries are now required to show the progress of the house before requesting release of funds at each stage of the construction.
    
    Earlier, civic bodies in the state – acting upon guidelines of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) – were releasing advance subsidy to beneficiary families constructing houses under the BLC (Beneficiary Led Construction) component of the PMAY(U) to ensure fast progress of the projects.
    
    However, this policy led to a considerable number of beneficiaries (about 20-25 per cent, as per MHADA officials) diverting the funds for other purposes, thus stalling the progress of construction. In several towns and cities in the state, PMAY(U) projects have not reached completion despite being under progress for one, two or more years.
    
    The Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed between March and August resulted in a drastic reduction in earnings of economically weaker families – the target demographic for the BLC component – and may have further led to diversion of the funds received from the state and central governments to ensure livelihood.
    
    “Considering past experience, we have decided to release the subsidy amount only after progress is shown at each stage,” Karbhari Divekar, Chief Officer, Pathri Municipal Council in Parbhani district. “Previously, we had deposited an upfront amount of Rs 40,000 in the accounts of the 1,050 beneficiaries when we gave them the building plan sanctions. But about 300 didn’t commence work,” he added.
    
    In Pathri, new 1550 PMAY(U) beneficiaries whose names appear in the latest BLC project plan, have been asked to commence the work on the homes and that they will receive the first installment of Rs 40,000 after the foundation work is done, additional Rs 60,000 when the work progresses until lintel-level and rest Rs 1.50 lakh after the work finishes.
    
    The beneficiaries are not too enthused about this strategy. “I will have to borrow money from private sources to start the work as I don’t have money to put in. As per the new strategy, only those who are well-off or have savings will be able to take advantage of the scheme,” said Laxmikant Ambure, a beneficiary.
    
    Central subsidy released in some towns
    
    Following The Indian Express report highlighting the status of the work on 1,150 houses sanctioned for PMAY(U) beneficiaries in several towns of the Marathwada region, MHADA – the state coordinating agency for PMAY(U) – has released the central subsidy for some of the towns.
    
    As per officials with Parbhani, Hingoli and Pathri municipal bodies, some central funds have been received in the recent weeks, enabling them to release the 3rd and 4th installment of the funds to the beneficiaries.
    
    Officials with Hingoli Municipal Council said they have received Rs 3.33 crore of the central subsidy while those in Pathri said they have received Rs 5 crore. “We had to wait for long. People really suffered as the work got stalled due to unavailability of funds. We hope that in future, the central funds will be released in a timely manner,” said Divekar.
    
    As reported earlier, the release of central funds for the BLC component has been severely delayed owing to failure of a section of the Urban Local Bodies (ULB) to submit the utilisation certificates (UC) for amounts earlier released.
    Top News Right Now
    
    Although MHADA’s Dilip Muglikar, who is in-charge of PMAY(U) implementation in the state, did not comment, officials in the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) said they are still awaiting the submission of UC’s from Maharashtra.
    
    “Of the total Rs 803 crore released, we have received the UC’s only for Rs 211 crore. The amount for which the UCs are due is close to Rs 550 crore. We won’t be able to release additional funds until we get UC’s for at least 80% of this amount,” said the a Ministry official who did not wish to be named`},

    title: "Adar Poonawalla of Serum Institute among 6 named ‘Asians of the Year’ by Singapore daily",
    content:`Adar Poonawalla, the chief executive of the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India, is among six people named “Asians of the Year” by Singapore’s leading daily, The Straits Times for their work in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.

    Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) has collaborated with the University of Oxford and the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for making the COVID-19 vaccine, ”Covidshield”, and is conducting trials in India.
    
    The other five named in the list are Chinese researcher Zhang Yongzhen, who led the team that mapped and published online the first complete genome of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that sparked the pandemic, China’s Major-General Chen Wei, Japan’s Dr Ryuichi Morishita and Singapore’s Professor Ooi Eng Eong, who are among those at the forefront of developing vaccines against the virus, and South Korean businessman Seo Jung-jin whose company will enable the making and dispensing of the vaccines and other Covid-19 treatments to the world.
    
    Collectively referred to as “the virus busters”, they are heroes of a kind, having devoted themselves to the pressing cause of resolving the coronavirus pandemic, each in their own capacity, the daily said.
    
    “Sars-CoV-2, the virus that has brought death and hardship to the world’s largest and most populous continent, is meeting its tamer in The Virus Busters,” the award citation said.
    
    “We salute your courage, care, commitment and creativity. In this peril-filled hour, you are a symbol of hope for Asia, indeed the world.”
    
    The Serum Institute was founded by Poonawalla’s father Cyrus Poonawalla in 1966.
    Poonawalla joined the Serum Institute of India in 2001 and became the CEO of Serum Institute with complete control of the day-to-day operations of the company in 2011.
    
    Poonawalla said that he has put USD 250 million of his family fortune into ramping up his institute’s manufacturing capacity.
    
    “I decided to go all out,” said Poonawalla, 39, who has pledged that his firm’s COVID-19 vaccines will help supply lower- and middle-income countries that face significant disadvantages in the quest to obtain them.
    
    Poonawalla said his institute is helping poorer countries level up in access to vaccines.
    
    In the big picture of ending the pandemic, commonality of purpose is key, said The Straits Times, Singapore’s mainstream daily.
    
    The Straits Times Asians of the Year have led the way, as have scores of other individuals in their own fields. When an end comes into sight, it will be due in no small part to these people who – undaunted by the tumult – have committed themselves to the sobering, much-needed work to put together an exit plan from the crisis, for humanity.
    
    “There has not been a day this year when the pandemic has not been in the news. Straits Times’ editors felt there could be no more deserving recipients this year than the people squaring up to Asia’s biggest-ever health challenge, engaged in pioneering and courageous efforts to prevent the highly contagious virus from wreaking more damage,” Bhagyashree
    
    Garekar, Straits Times’ foreign editor, said on Saturday.
    
    “In a year that is ending with a wish for great resets… Asia’s virus busters are the face of hope on the horizon,” said Garekar.
    
    Between them, the recipients of the 2020 award capture the entire trajectory of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
    In deciding to honour The Virus Busters, Straits Times editors had in mind those who have, in one way or another, enabled the complex, multi-stage process of preventing as many people around the world from getting the deadly disease in as little time as possible.
    
    “Each year, ST editors seek out a person, team or organisation that has not only made or shaped the news, but also helped contribute positively to Asia in the process,” said Warren Fernandez, editor-in-chief of Singapore Press Holdings’ English/Malay/Tamil Media Group and editor of Straits Times.
    
    “This year, we naturally looked to those involved in the fight against Covid-19, which has dominated the headlines. We debated long and hard, but finally agreed on a group of people who have done the most to help find an answer to the crisis brought on by the virus.
    
    “They are a disparate group whose collective efforts have pushed forward the search for vaccines, allowing these to be discovered and delivered with an urgency never attempted or seen before. Their commitment and actions have helped save lives and give hope to people all around Asia, and the world,” Fernandez said.`},
